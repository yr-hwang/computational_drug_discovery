# Computational Drug Discovery

The purpose of this project is to build a machine learning model using the ChEMBL bioactivity data. The compounds were labelled as either being active, inactive, or intermediate based on their IC50 units. Exploratory data analysis was also done based on the Lipinski descriptors of the compounds. A regression model was built using random forest and a comparison between different regressors was done.
